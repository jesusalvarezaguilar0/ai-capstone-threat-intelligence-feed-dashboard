## Checkpoint 2 Readiness Assessment

### Status: AT RISK

### What's Working
* The Flowise LLM chains are operational and processing inputs correctly.
* The n8n HTTP Request nodes successfully establish a connection to Flowise.
* AI summarization and IOC extraction modules are functioning as expected.
* Initial Airtable integration correctly writes data to the database.

### Critical Gaps (must fix before Checkpoint 2)
* Resolve the JSON formatting errors occurring in the HTTP request bodies between n8n and Flowise to prevent the pipeline from breaking before it reaches Component 3.
  * Owner: Safayet Safin and Harry Yachimba
* Implement the necessary improvements to the relevance scoring logic to guarantee accurate threat prioritization.
  * Owner: Julian Silva-Erazo
* Construct and finalize the presentation dashboard within Airtable to display the prioritized threat records.
  * Owner: Safayet Safin
* Execute one complete record flow through all four components end to end without any manual intervention.
  * Owner: Safayet Safin

### Schema Issues Found
* Field name formatting must be strictly validated to ensure outputs from Flowise precisely match the Airtable schema expectations.
* The AI JSON responses need to strictly utilize snake_case for fields including `attack_type` and `relevance_score` to maintain convention compliance.

### Recommended Fix Order
1. Debug and stabilize the JSON payload formatting within the n8n HTTP Request nodes to secure the data transfer between the AI Core and the Relevance Scorer.
2. Finalize the relevance scoring logic in Component 3 to complete the data enrichment lifecycle.
3. Build the Airtable presentation dashboard to visualize the final output for end users.
4. Run a comprehensive end to end automation test utilizing a single standard record.

### Test Data Gaps
* The database currently lacks a robust set of edge cases and bad data to thoroughly evaluate the system error handling capabilities.
* Specific records to add include:
  * A threat intelligence report that exceeds standard character limits to test parsing constraints.
  * A threat alert explicitly missing standard Indicators of Compromise, such as CVEs, to validate the AI fallback logic.
  * An intentionally malformed JSON payload into the pipeline to verify the workflow error routing mechanisms.
